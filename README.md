# Bounty Bot
Replit's new Bounties feature is great! But I want to stay on top of the latest bounties, without perpetually keeping a tab open. The solution? Write a Discord bot to notify me when there's a new bounty.

# How it Works
Every 15 minutes the bot will send a request from [replit.com/bounties](https://replit.com/bounties) to [replit.com/graphql](https://replit.com/graphql) asking it for the 3 most recent bounties, it then uses the ID of the bounty (which goes up by one every new bounty) in order to figure out how many of the 3 bounties it grabbed are new in the past 15 minutes. If there are more than 3 bounties posted in 15 minutes, panic. This is likely not the best way to do it, since I think there is a WebSocket for bounties, but because of the lack of documentation it's not feasible to work out an implementation for this at the moment.
