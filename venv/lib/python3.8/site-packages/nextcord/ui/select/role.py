    ------------
    custom_id: :class:`str`
        The ID of the select menu that gets received during an interaction.
        If not given then one is generated for you.
    placeholder: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The placeholder text that is shown if nothing is selected, if any.
    min_values: :class:`int`
        The minimum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    max_values: :class:`int`
        The maximum number of items that must be chosen for this select menu.
        Defaults to 1 and must be between 1 and 25.
    disabled: :class:`bool`
        Whether the select is disabled or not. Defaults to ``False``.
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The relative row this select menu belongs to. A Discord component can only have 5
        rows. By default, items are arranged automatically into those 5 rows. If you'd
        like to control the relative positioning of the row then passing an index is advised.
        For example, row=1 will show up before row=2. Defaults to ``None``, which is automatic
        ordering. The row number must be between 0 and 4 (i.e. zero indexed).
